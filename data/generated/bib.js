Among the cheapest sources of freshwater are natural water resources like groundwater and waterways. Nevertheless, both industrial and human activities in addition to other geological cycles have the potential to contaminate these resources. Pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification are some of the factors that make up the water quality predictive model.

Unlike traditional models used in water-related research, data-driven models based on machine learning can efficiently solve more complex nonlinear problems. In water environment research, models and conclusions derived from machine learning have been applied to the construction, monitoring, simulation, evaluation, and optimization of various water treatment and management systems. Additionally, machine learning can provide solutions for water pollution control, water quality improvement, and watershed ecosystem security management. In this review, we describe the cases in which machine learning algorithms have been applied to evaluate the water quality in different water environments, such as surface water, groundwater, drinking water, sewage, and seawater. Furthermore, we propose possible future applications of machine learning approaches to water environments.",

        "abstract": "Water quality monitoring is an important component of water resources management. In order to predict two water quality variables, namely dissolved oxygen (DO; mg/L) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a; \u00b5g/L) in the Small Prespa Lake in Greece, two standalone deep learning (DL) models, the long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models, along with their hybrid, the CNN\u2013LSTM model, were developed. The main novelty of this study was to build a coupled CNN\u2013LSTM model to predict water quality variables. Two traditional machine learning models, support-vector regression (SVR) and decision tree (DT), were also developed to compare with the DL models. Time series of the physicochemical water quality variables, specifically pH, oxidation\u2013reduction potential (ORP; mV), water temperature (\u00b0C), electrical conductivity (EC; \u00b5S/cm), DO and Chl-a, were obtained using a sensor at 15-min intervals from June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013 for model development. Lag times of up to one (t\u2009\u2212\u20091) and two (t\u2009\u2212\u20092) for input variables pH, ORP, water temperature, and EC were used to predict DO and Chl-a concentrations, respectively. Each model\u2019s performance in both training and testing phases was assessed using statistical metrics including the correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), their normalized equivalents (RRMSE, RMAE; %), percentage of bias (PBIAS), Nash\u2013Sutcliffe coefficient (\\(E_{NS}\\)), Willmott\u2019s Index, and graphical plots (Taylor diagram, box plot and spider diagram). Results showed that LSTM outperformed the CNN model for DO prediction, but the standalone DL models yielded similar performances for Chl-a prediction. Generally, the hybrid CNN\u2013LSTM models outperformed the standalone models (LSTM, CNN, SVR and DT models) in predicting both DO and Chl-a. By integrating the LSTM and CNN models, the hybrid model successfully captured both the low and high levels of the water quality variables, particularly for the DO concentrations.",

The integration of advanced machine learning models offers promising avenues for accurate water quality prediction, enabling proactive measures to safeguard water sources.

Results demonstrated the hybrid model's superior performance, with mean squared errors (MSEs) of 0.0015 and 0.0361 for pH and DO prediction, respectively. For Water Quality Classification (WQC), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNNs), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Light gradient Boosting Machine (Light GBM) were employed, with SVM achieving the highest accuracy at 88.75%. The research underscores the effectiveness of the CNN\u2013LSTM model in predicting pH and DO levels. Leveraging these predictions as inputs to the SVM model offers valuable insights, particularly in regions where conventional monitoring methods face limitations.

        "abstract": "Five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) is a vital wastewater contamination strength indicator. The process of measuring BOD5 is to measure the mass of molecular oxygen consumed in 1 L of water at 20 \u00b0C over a 5-day incubation period. It is a time-consuming process and often too late for water management agencies to make a timely reaction if the result of measurement shows a water body is seriously polluted. Biosensors can simplify the process of BOD5 measurement; however, the measurement results often deviate significantly from the measured BOD5 values. The main aim of this research is to identify a machine learning model, which could predict BOD5 value from historical data and make it easier to detect water pollution in advance and timely adopt treatment measures. Three machine learning techniques, linear regression, support vector regression (SVR) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and two optimization processes have been studied in this research. Four main steps, preprocessing (one-time only), model training, model evaluation (testing) and analysis have been implemented in the experiments. With three feature selection strategies, the results of the experiment showed that SVR with genetic algorithm (GA) optimizer achieved the best performance with R2 of 0.694 and the lowest MAE of 0.109.",

        "abstract": "Biological oxygen demand (BOD5) is an indicator used to monitor water quality. However, the standard process of measuring BOD5 is time consuming and could delay crucial mitigation works in the event of pollution. To solve this problem, this study employed multiple machine learning (ML) methods such as random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) to train a best model that can accurately predict the BOD5 values in water samples based on other physical and chemical properties of the water. The training parameters were optimized using genetic algorithm (GA) and feature selection was made using the sequential feature selection (SFS) method. The proposed machine learning framework was first tested on a public dataset (Waterbase). The MLP method produced the best model, with an R2 score of 0.7672791942775417, relative mean squared error (MSE) and relative mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 15%. Feature importance calculations indicated that chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), ammonium and nitrate are features that highly correlate to BOD5. In the field study with a small private dataset consisting of water samples collected from two different lakes in Jiangsu Province of China, the trained model was found to have a similar range of prediction error (around 15%), a similar relative MAE (around 14%) and achieved about 6% better relative RMSE.",

Chl-a, a pigment present in diverse aquatic organisms, notably algae and cyanobacteria, serves as a valuable indicator of water quality. Thus, the objectives of this study encompass: (1) the assessment of the predictive capabilities of four deep learning (DL) models \u2014 namely, recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrence unit (GRU), and temporal convolutional network (TCN) \u2014 in forecasting Chl-a concentrations; (2) the incorporation of these DL models into ensemble models (EMs) employing genetic algorithm (GA) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to harness the strengths of each standalone model; and (3) the evaluation of the efficacy of the developed EMs. Utilizing data collected at 15-min intervals from Small Prespa Lake (SPL) in Greece, the models employed hourly Chl-a concentration lag times, extending up to 6 h, as models\u2019 inputs to forecast Chla (t+1). The proposed models underwent training on 70% of the dataset and were subsequently validated on the remaining 30%. Among the standalone DL models, the GRU model exhibited superior performance in Chl-a forecasting, surpassing the RNN, LSTM, and TCN models by 8%, 2%, and 2%, respectively. Furthermore, the integration of DL models through single-objective GA and multi-objective NSGA-II optimization algorithms yielded hybrid models adept at effectively forecasting both low and high Chl-a concentrations.
