        "abstract": "With the rapid increase in the volume of data on the aquatic environment, machine learning has become an important tool for data analysis, classification, and prediction. Unlike traditional models used in water-related research, data-driven models based on machine learning can efficiently solve more complex nonlinear problems. In water environment research, models and conclusions derived from machine learning have been applied to the construction, monitoring, simulation, evaluation, and optimization of various water treatment and management systems. Additionally, machine learning can provide solutions for water pollution control, water quality improvement, and watershed ecosystem security management. In this review, we describe the cases in which machine learning algorithms have been applied to evaluate the water quality in different water environments, such as surface water, groundwater, drinking water, sewage, and seawater. Furthermore, we propose possible future applications of machine learning approaches to water environments.",

        "abstract": "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) combined with a deep learning approach was created by combining CNN and LSTM networks simulated water quality including total nitrogen, total phosphorous, and total organic carbon. Water level and water quality data in the Nakdong river basin were collected from the Water Resources Management Information System (WAMIS) and the Real-Time Water Quality Information, respectively. The rainfall radar image and operation information of estuary barrage were also collected from the Korea Meteorological Administration. In this study, CNN was used to simulate the water level and LSTM used for water quality. The entire simulation period was 1 January 2016\u201316 November 2017 and divided into two parts: (1) calibration (1 January 2016\u20131 March 2017); and (2) validation (2 March 2017\u201316 November 2017). This study revealed that the performances of both of the CNN and LSTM models were in the \u201cvery good\u201d range with above the Nash\u2013Sutcliffe efficiency value of 0.75 and that those models well represented the temporal variations of the pollutants in Nakdong river basin (NRB). It is concluded that the proposed approach in this study can be useful to accurately simulate the water level and water quality.",
